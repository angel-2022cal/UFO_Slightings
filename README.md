# UFO_Slightings

![](image/readme_picture.png)

### The Purpose of This Project

In this project, we will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. We will build 
a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. In javascript, you will create filters to make the UFO table fully dynamic,
meaning it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. And then, we use HTML to 
build the paragraph and title to the website. In the end, we use CSS to customize the website to make it looks pretty. 

### The Technologies Used

    * JavaScript 
    
    * CSS
    
    * Bootstrap 
    
    * HTML
    

### Recommendations for Further Development 

For Future recommendations, I would design the button for each city to ensure that they are able to connect together by clicking back or clicking 
forwards.
